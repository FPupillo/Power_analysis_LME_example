# Power_analysis_LME_example

This folder contains an example of a power analysis for linear mixed effects models.
The example consists of a hypothetical study run with two groups (called "lowPE" and "HighPE"), 
for which we are simulating RT with some default parameters. The script that simulates the data
is the "simData.R" script. 

The "PowerAnalysisScript.R" runs the simulation across increasing numbers of participants
 and items.
